  aboutMe:
    "I am a software developer and a current Master's (MCA) candidate with a dual passion for building user-centric full-stack applications and diving deep into system-level internals. My project work spans from developing AI-powered web platforms with React and Django to engineering a LineageOS-compatible device tree for Android hardware. I am driven by a persistent curiosity for how things work, from a web app's REST API down to the Linux kernel. I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to challenging projects, particularly in AOSP, Android systems, or full-stack development.",
